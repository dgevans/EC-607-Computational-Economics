        "\n",

        "    * By how much does does policy P improve some measure of welfare  \n",

        "2. Use structural theory of the economy (model) to derive quantitative implications of theory \n",

        "3. Parameters of the model are **calibrated** along some dimensions of the data and used to explain **other dimensions** \n",

        "## Step 2: Choose the Model\n",
        "* Build up from an established theory: e.g. the neoclassical growth model, the NK model, the Hugget-Aiyagari model\n",

        "Use empirical moments used to calibrate the model should be different than the onese the model aims to account for, i.e.\n",
